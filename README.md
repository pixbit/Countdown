This is my new README file. read me to learn how to use this plugin.

target: the future anticipated date used to count down to.

parts: An array of units of time you would like to include, for example: days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

separator: The visual separator you would like to divide the units of time with. Default is :. Other choices are short OR full. If you use short as the separator, the separators will be the first letter of each unit of time they represent (d, h, m, s). If you use full as the separator, the separators will be the unit of time entirely like this (Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds).

leadingZero: Do you want a zero appended to the units of time? True or False.

height: The height of the numbers. This is important for the timer to scroll correctly.

speed: The speed in which the units of time transition in Milliseconds. Default is 700 Keep this under 1 second as the timer could become inaccurate.
